* Add behavior:
  - To react to events or 
  - To execute computation in the view
* Add behavior to the <a class="x-grid-item"  href='/slidedeck/#1. Overview/2 Core-Concepts/7. Scope' target="_blank">scope</a> by attaching methods to the $scope object
* These methods are then available to be called from the template/view

```js
var myApp = angular.module('myApp',[]);

myApp.controller('DoubleController', ['$scope', function($scope) {
  $scope.double = function(value) { return value * 2; };
}]);
```

```html
<div ng-controller="DoubleController">
  Two times <input ng-model="num"> equals {{ double(num) }}
</div>
```

#### Explanation:

Here behavior is added to the scope as methods to react in the views.

If above example double is observed a method defined as scope variable and is used in the expressions to display result from `double` method. when ever user gives input scope variable `num` is updated and is passed to `double` method as a argument/parameter.`double` method in script can be seen, what ever the input/ parameter is passed to it is going to be doubled by multiplying with 2.
