* We add behavior:
  - To react to events or 
  - To execute computation in the view
* We add behavior to the scope by attaching methods to the $scope object
* These methods are then available to be called from the template/view

```js
var myApp = angular.module('myApp',[]);

myApp.controller('DoubleController', ['$scope', function($scope) {
  $scope.double = function(value) { return value * 2; };
}]);
```

```html
<div ng-controller="DoubleController">
  Two times <input ng-model="num"> equals {{ double(num) }}
</div>
```

#### Explanation:

Here we add behavior to the scope as methods to react in the views.

If we see in the above example double is a method defined as scope variable and is used in the expressions to display result from `double` method. when ever user gives input scope variable `num` is updated and is passed to `double` method as a argument/parameter. We can see `double` method in script, what ever the input/ parameter is passed to it is going to be doubled by multiplying with 2.
