* Can associate Controllers with scope objects implicitly via 
  - the `ngController` directive or 
  - `$route` service

###ng-controller
To create a $scope object, weâ€™ll attach a controller object to a DOM element using the ng-controller directive on an object, like so:

The controller instance can be published into a scope property by specifying ng-controller="as propertyName".

```html
<div ng-controller="MyController">
  {{ person.name }}
</div>
```
<p data-height="268" data-theme-id="0" data-slug-hash="jbdQdo" data-default-tab="result" data-user="walkingtree" class='codepen'>See the Pen <a href='http://codepen.io/walkingtree/pen/jbdQdo/'>jbdQdo</a> by Walking Tree (<a href='http://codepen.io/walkingtree'>@walkingtree</a>) on <a href='http://codepen.io'>CodePen</a>.</p>

#### Explanation
In the above exapmle we are defining methods in the scope and calling in the view.


When ever we use `ng-controller` in the view, particular block can access everything in the controller through scope.
We if dont want to use scope we can use aliasing of the controller `ng-controller="controller as ctrl"` through this we can access methods in the controller using `ctrl.particularMethos()`.

We have call these methods by directives like ng-click etc.
 `:bulb: Note : Please refer topic Directives to know more about inbuilt directives.`
