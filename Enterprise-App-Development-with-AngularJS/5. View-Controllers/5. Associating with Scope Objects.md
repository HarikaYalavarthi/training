* Can associate Controllers with scope objects implicitly via 
  - the `ngController` directive or 
  - `$route` service

###ng-controller
To create a $scope object, weâ€™ll attach a controller object to a DOM element using the ng-controller directive on an object, like so:

The controller instance can be published into a scope property by specifying ng-controller="as propertyName".

```html
<div ng-controller="MyController">
  {{ person.name }}
</div>
```
