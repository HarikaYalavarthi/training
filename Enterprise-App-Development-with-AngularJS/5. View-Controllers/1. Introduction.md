* Controllers are essentially the entry-point into front-end business logic; they should contain all the methods that super-simple code in page should call. 
* Controllers also allow to initialize the scope with the models that page uses. (I was about to say that controllers hold models, but thatâ€™s not true, models go on the scope, not on the controllers).

`ðŸ’¡ Note: Please refer topic Scope for more details on Scope`

```script
 var myModule = angular.module('myModule', []);
 myModule.controller('myController', function($scope) {
    });
```
* Controller is a JavaScript constructor function that is used to augment the Angular Scope
* Controller is attached to the DOM via the ng-controller directive
* A new child scope will be available as an injectable parameter to the Controller's constructor function as $scope
