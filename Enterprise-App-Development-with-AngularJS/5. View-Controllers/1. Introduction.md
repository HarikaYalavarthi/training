To exercise restraint or direction over; dominate; command

###Introduction :
In general how some amount of JavaScript code can be managed or used instead of having everything. The amount of JavaScript required on a page for applications becomes unmanageable when embedded in event handlers(Onclick, Onmouse) or elsewhere in the page. And just like development in any other environment, need a good separation of concerns.
When working with JavaScript, our front-end applications are becoming more complex enough that they are applications in their own right. This means that in addition to JavaScript code that is just wire-up to controls on the page (event handlers that just call a function for example), also have more involvement, business logic, that really doesnâ€™t belong directly on the page. Even data-layer code when ajax calls should be considered as data-layer. 
Controllers are essentially the entry-point into front-end business logic; they should contain all the methods that super-simple code in page should call. Controllers also allow to initialize the scope with the models that page uses. (I was about to say that controllers hold models, but thatâ€™s not true, models go on the scope, not on the controllers).

###Creating and Referencing a Controllers
```script
 var myModule = angular.module('myModule', []);
 myModule.controller('myController', function($scope) {
    });
```
* Controller is a JavaScript constructor function that is used to augment the Angular Scope
* Controller is attached to the DOM via the ng-controller directive
* A new child scope will be available as an injectable parameter to the Controller's constructor function as $scope
