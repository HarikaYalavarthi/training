```html
<div ng-controller="GreetingController">
  {{ greeting }}
</div>
```

<p data-height="268" data-theme-id="0" data-slug-hash="rOoNMO" data-default-tab="result" data-user="walkingtree" class='codepen'>See the Pen <a href='http://codepen.io/walkingtree/pen/rOoNMO/'>rOoNMO</a> by Walking Tree (<a href='http://codepen.io/walkingtree'>@walkingtree</a>) on <a href='http://codepen.io'>CodePen</a>.</p>
