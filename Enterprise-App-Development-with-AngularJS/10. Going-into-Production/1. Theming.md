The Angular Material project is an implementation of Material Design in Angular.js. This project provides a set of reusable, well-tested, and accessible UI components based on the Material Design system.

Similar to the Polymer project's Paper elements collection, Angular Material is supported internally at Google by the Angular.js, Material Design UX and other product teams.

What is Material Design?
Material Design is a specification for a unified system of visual, motion, and interaction design that adapts across different devices and different screen sizes.

Theming 
In most applications, declaring multiple themes is not necessary. Instead, you should configure the default theme for your needs. If you need multiple themes in a single application, Angular Material does provide tools to make this possible.

Registering another theme
Use the $mdThemingProvider to register a second theme within your application. By default all themes will inherit from the default theme. Once you have registered the second theme, you can configure it with the same chainable interface used on the default theme.

```angular.module('myApp', ['ngMaterial'])
.config(function($mdThemingProvider) {
  $mdThemingProvider.theme('altTheme')
    .primaryPalette('purple') // specify primary color, all
                            // other color intentions will be inherited
                            // from default
});
```
