**1. AngularJS as Dynamic Web App Framework**

AngularJS is an open-source JavaScript framework developed by Google. It
helps you to create single-page applications or one-page web
applications that only require HTML, CSS, and JavaScript on the client
side. It is based on MV-\* pattern and allow you to build well
structured, easily testable, and maintainable front-end applications.

AngularJS has changed the way to web development. It is not based on
jQuery to perform its operations. In spite of using ASP.NET Web form,
ASP.NET MVC, PHP, JSP, Ruby on Rails for web development, you can do
your complete web development by using most powerful and adaptive
JavaScript Framework AngularJS. There is no doubt, JavaScript frameworks
like AngularJS, Ember etc. are the future of web development.
