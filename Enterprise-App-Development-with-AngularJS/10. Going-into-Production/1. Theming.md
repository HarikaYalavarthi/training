The Angular Material project is an implementation of Material Design in Angular.js.

```html
ðŸ’¡ Note: Material Design is a specification for a unified system of visual, motion, and interaction design that adapts across different devices and 
  different screen sizes.
```

####Theming 
* In most applications, declaring multiple themes is not necessary. Instead,default theme should be configured for needs.
* If multiple themes is needed in a single application, Angular Material does provide tools to make this possible.
* Use the $mdThemingProvider to register a second theme within application. By default all themes will inherit from the default theme. Once registered the second theme, configure it with the same chainable interface used on the default theme.

```
angular.module('myApp', ['ngMaterial'])
.config(function($mdThemingProvider) {
  $mdThemingProvider.theme('altTheme')
    .primaryPalette('purple') // specify primary color, all
                            // other color intentions will be inherited
                            // from default
});
```
