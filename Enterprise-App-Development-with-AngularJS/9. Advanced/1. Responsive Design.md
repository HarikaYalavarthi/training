A set of AngularJS <a class="x-grid-item"  href='/slidedeck/#1. Overview/2 Core-Concepts/5. Directives' target="_blank">directives</a> to help with responsive design.

There are basically two basic strategies:
* Use different views for each target device type, this increases the workload on web designers because they have to create a different HTML file for each supported device type.
* Use a single combined HTML file that uses CSS and media queries to hide those sections that should not be visible on a particular device. This decreases the workload on web designers, but sections that are not displayed still pull images and take up DOM processing time.
