The $http service is a core Angular service that facilitates communication with the remote HTTP servers via the browser's XMLHttpRequest object or via JSONP.

For unit testing applications that use $http service, see $httpBackend mock.

For a higher level of abstraction, please check out the $resource service.

The $http API is based on the deferred/promise APIs exposed by the $q service. While for simple usage patterns this doesn't matter much, for advanced usage it is important to familiarize yourself with these APIs and the guarantees they provide.

#### Explanation
Up on $http call we will get response wether it may be a bad or good response. Up on success it will go to success function and sets values to the attributes. If the response is an error then it will go to error function and it will be handled.
