* Expression Sandboxing
* Design your template properly
  - Do not mix client and server templates
  - Do not use user input to generate templates dynamically
  - Do not run user input through $scope.$eval
* JSON Vulnerability
  - Retrieve JSON with POST request
  - Prefix response with “)]}’,\n”
* XSRF (Cros-site Request Forgery)
  - Server must set XSRF-TOKEN session cookie
  - Use X-XSRF-TOKEN in HTTP header to establish valid requestor

JSON Vulnerability Protection
A JSON vulnerability allows third party website to turn your JSON resource URL into JSONP request under some conditions. To counter this your server can prefix all JSON requests with following string ")]}',\n". Angular will automatically strip the prefix before processing it as JSON.

For example if your server needs to return:
```js
['one','two']
```
which is vulnerable to attack, your server can return:
```js
)]}',
['one','two']
```
Angular will strip the prefix, before processing the JSON.
