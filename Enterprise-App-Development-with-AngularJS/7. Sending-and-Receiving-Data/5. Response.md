The response object has these properties:

* data â€“ {string|Object} â€“ The response body transformed with the transform functions.
* status â€“ {number} â€“ HTTP status code of the response.
* headers â€“ {function([headerName])} â€“ Header getter function.
* config â€“ {Object} â€“ The configuration object that was used to generate the request.
* statusText â€“ {string} â€“ HTTP status text of the response.

A response status code between 200 and 299 is considered a success status and will result in the success callback being called. If response is expected as response,Json is converted to array using `angular.fromJson`

ðŸ’¡ Note: if the response is a redirect, XMLHttpRequest will transparently follow it, meaning that the error callback will not be called for such responses.
