* Lets work with REST services
* Include angular-resource.js
* ngResource module needs to be added as a dependency
* Inject and use $resource service
* Offers additional methods - get, query, save, remove, delete


Use Angularâ€™s high-level $resource service. Note that the Angular ngResource module needs to be separately loaded since it is not included in the base angular.js file:

`<script src="angular-resource.js">`
Let us now start by defining the application module and our Post model as an Angular service:

`var app = angular.module('myApp', ['ngResource']);

app.factory("Post", function($resource) {
  return $resource("/api/posts/:id");
});`


Now we can use our service to retrieve a list of posts inside a controller (example: HTTP GET /api/posts):
`
app.controller("PostIndexCtrl", function($scope, Post) {
  Post.query(function(data) {
    $scope.posts = data;
  });
});`


Or a specific post by id (example: HTTP GET /api/posts/1):
`
app.controller("PostShowCtrl", function($scope, Post) {
  Post.get({ id: 1 }, function(data) {
    $scope.post = data;
  });
});`


We can create a new post using save (example: HTTP POST /api/posts):

`
Post.save(data);`

And we can delete a specific post by id (example: DELETE /api/posts/1):

`
Post.delete({ id: id });`
