The streamlined ES6 style promise is essentially just using $q as a constructor which takes a resolver function as the first argument. This is similar to the native Promise implementation from ES6 Harmony, see MDN.

While the constructor-style use is supported, not all of the supporting methods from ES6 Harmony promises are available yet.

It can be used like so:

```script
function asyncGreet(name) {
  // perform some asynchronous operation, resolve or reject the promise when appropriate.
  return $q(function(resolve, reject) {
    setTimeout(function() {
      if (okToGreet(name)) {
        resolve('Hello, ' + name + '!');
      } else {
        reject('Greeting ' + name + ' is not allowed.');
      }
    }, 1000);
  });
}

var promise = asyncGreet('Robin Hood');
promise.then(function(greeting) {
  alert('Success: ' + greeting);
}, function(reason) {
  alert('Failed: ' + reason);
});
```
Note: progress/notify callbacks are not currently supported via the ES6-style interface.

Note: unlike ES6 behaviour, an exception thrown in the constructor function will NOT implicitly reject the promise.

However, the more traditional CommonJS-style usage is still available, and documented below.

The CommonJS Promise proposal describes a promise as an interface for interacting with an object that represents the result of an action that is performed asynchronously, and may or may not be finished at any given point in time.

From the perspective of dealing with error handling, deferred and promise APIs are to asynchronous programming what try, catch and throw keywords are to synchronous programming.
