$q service helps run functions asynchronously, and use their return values (or exceptions) when they are done processing

* $q.defer(); – creates a new deferred
* deferred.resolve(value); – resolves a deferred with a value
* deferred.reject(reason); – rejects a deferred with a reason
* deferred.promise; – gets a promise from deferred
* promise.then(success, failure); – assigns callbacks for success (resolve) and failure (reject)
* promise.catch(failure); – assigns failure callback (equals to promise.then(null, failure))
* promise.finally(always); – assign a callback to be called both on success or failure
* $q.reject(reason); – returns rejected promise with a reason
* $q.when(valueOrPromise); – wraps value or other implementation of thenable promise with AngularJS promise
* $q.all(promisesArr); – returns a promise that will be resolved only when all promises in `promisesArr` are resolved

* Promise dictates the following for async requests:
* Async request return a promise instead of a return value
* The Promise has a then function, which has two arguments
  - a function to handle “resolved” or “success” event
  - a function to handle the “rejected” or “failure” event
* It is guaranteed that one of the two callbacks will be called, as soon as the result is available
