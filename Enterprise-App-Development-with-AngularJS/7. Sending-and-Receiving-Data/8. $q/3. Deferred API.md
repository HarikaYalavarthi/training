A new instance of deferred is constructed by calling ```$q.defer()```.The purpose of the deferred object is to expose the associated Promise instance, APIs that can be used for signaling the successful or unsuccessful completion, status of the task.

Methods

* resolve(value) – resolves the derived promise with the value. If the value is a rejection constructed via $q.reject, the promise will be rejected instead.
* reject(reason) – rejects the derived promise with the reason. This is equivalent to resolving it with a rejection constructed via $q.reject.
* notify(value) - provides updates on the status of the promise's execution. This may be called multiple times before the promise is either resolved or rejected.
Properties

promise – {Promise} – promise object associated with this deferred.
