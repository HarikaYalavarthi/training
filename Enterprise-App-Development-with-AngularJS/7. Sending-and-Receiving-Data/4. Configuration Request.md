The $http service is a function which takes a single argument — a configuration object — that is used to generate an HTTP request and returns a promise.

```
// Simple GET request example:
$http({
  method: 'GET',
  url: '/someUrl'
}).then(function successCallback(response) {
    // this callback will be called asynchronously
    // when the response is available
  }, function errorCallback(response) {
    // called asynchronously if an error occurs
    // or server returns response with an error status.
  });

```
The response object has these properties:
*	data – {string|Object} – The response body transformed with the transform functions.
*	status – {number} – HTTP status code of the response.
*	headers – {function([headerName])} – Header getter function.
*	config – {Object} – The configuration object that was used to generate the request.
*	statusText – {string} – HTTP status text of the response.

A response status code between 200 and 299 is considered a success status and will result in the success callback being called. Note that if the response is a redirect, XMLHttpRequest will transparently follow it, meaning that the error callback will not be called for such responses.
