Setting an interceptor in module config let us intercept calls (and all behaviours, like request, request error, response and response error, .etc).

Here, when API call starts, the interceptor captures the request call, and store the resquest timestamp; when call responds, a time value is calculted using response's timestamp.

We could have several calls from differents services and may want to use interceptor logic for just some of them. Many approaches could fit the need, I choose a simple one: adding a custom property in our service that we can use in our interceptor to change its behaviour.
