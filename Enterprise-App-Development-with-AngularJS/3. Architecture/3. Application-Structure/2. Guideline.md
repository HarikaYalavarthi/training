[Google Recommendation](https://docs.google.com/document/u/1/d/1XXMvReO8-Awi1EZXAXS4PzDzdNvV6pGcuaF4Q9821Es/pub) about the application folder structure

`gulp-angular` generator that comes with Yoeman is close to the recommendation

This is how you setup the project with Gulp:
```
npm install -g generator-gulp-angular
```
```
yo gulp-angular [app name]
```
