####Explanation of the diagram

The model manages the behavior and data of the application domain, responds to requests for information about its state (usually from the view), and responds to instructions to change state (usually from the controller) while the view manages the display of information and the controller interprets the mouse and keyboard inputs from the user, informing the model and/or the view to change as appropriate.


ðŸ’¡ Note:  Both the view and the controller depend on the model. However, the model depends on neither the view nor the controller. 

Much of the time when youâ€™re building application you will need:

*	Model to represent current state of your application
*	View to display the data
*	Controller that controls the relation between Models and Views.

We will cover these three components in angular, one by one.

####Model

A model in angular can be a primitive type such as string, number, boolean or a complex type such as object. Thereâ€™s no special class, no special getter or setter method, in short model is just a plain javascript object.

####View

View is what the users see, in angular view is the Document Object Model (DOM). To display the data from controller, you can put angular expression in your view. This expression binds data from model inside your controller. Since angular is <a class="x-grid-item"  href='/slidedeck/#6. View-Models-and-Data-Binding/5. Two-way Binding' target="_blank">two-way data binding</a> the view will update automatically if thereâ€™s a model changes from your controller. You donâ€™t need to write additional code manually to achieve this.

####Controller

Speaking the concept of controller under MVC pattern, controller is the place where we put our application logic. In angular, controller is simply formed by javascript classes. In this controller we can also call other components to work with. And the most important to explain is, in this controller your model lives.

`ðŸ’¡ Note: We will be talking about controllers in detail in Separating Control Logic later.`
