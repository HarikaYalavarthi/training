Much of the time when you’re building application you will need:

*	Model to represent current state of your application
*	View to display the data
*	Controller that controls the relation between Models and Views.

We will cover these three components in angular, one by one.

####Model

A model in angular can be a primitive type such as string, number, boolean or a complex type such as object. There’s no special class, no special getter or setter method, in short model is just a plain javascript object.

####View

View is what the users see, in angular view is the Document Object Model (DOM). To display the data from controller, you can put angular expression in your view. This expression binds data from model inside your controller. Since angular is two-way data binding the view will update automatically if there’s a model changes from your controller. You don’t need to write additional code manually to achieve this.

####Controller

Speaking the concept of controller under MVC pattern, controller is the place where we put our application logic. In angular, controller is simply formed by javascript classes. In this controller we can also call other components to work with. And the most important to explain is, in this controller your model lives.
