####Model

* A model could be a single object, or it could be some structure of objects.

* Model is where the applicationâ€™s data objects are stored.

* There should be a one-to-one correspondence between the model and its parts on the one hand, and the represented world as perceived by the owner of the model on the other hand. 

* The nodes of a model should therefore represent an identifiable part of the problem.

* The nodes of a model should all be on the same problem level, it is confusing and considered bad form to mix problem-oriented nodes (e.g. calendar appointments) with implementation details (e.g. paragraphs).
