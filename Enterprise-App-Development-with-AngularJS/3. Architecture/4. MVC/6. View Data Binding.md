###Overview

Data-binding is the automatic synchronization of data between the model and view components.
The view is a projection of the model at all times. When the model changes, the view reflects the change, and vice versa.

###Features

First the template (which is the uncompiled HTML along with any additional markup or directives) is compiled on the browser.
Any changes to the view are immediately reflected in the model, and any changes in the model are propagated to the view.
The model is greatly simplifying the programming model for the developer,because the view is just a projection of the model,the controller is completely separated from the view and unaware of it. 

This makes testing a snap because it is easy to test your controller in isolation without the view and the related DOM/browser dependency.

Example:

<p data-height="268" data-theme-id="0" data-slug-hash="qOLOaR" data-default-tab="result" data-user="walkingtree" class='codepen'>See the Pen <a href='http://codepen.io/walkingtree/pen/qOLOaR/'>qOLOaR</a> by Walking Tree (<a href='http://codepen.io/walkingtree'>@walkingtree</a>) on <a href='http://codepen.io'>CodePen</a>.</p>
