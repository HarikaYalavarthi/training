For flexibilty and resuability we should be splitting code between controllers.

The means when you first define you application you might just create the following files and structure.
app.js
```script
angular.module('myApp', []);
```
FirstController.js
```script
angular.module('myApp').controller('FirstController', function () {});
```
SecondController.js
`angular.module('myApp').controller('SecondController', function () {});`

If you now include these files in your html document in this particularly order (at least app.js has to come first), your application works just fine with two separate controllers in two separate files.
