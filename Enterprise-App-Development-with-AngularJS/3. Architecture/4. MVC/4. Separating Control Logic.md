 Most of the developers starts application with one controller and ends with same.
 They wont look for flexibilty and resuability by splitting code between controllers.
 We can split logic between controllers by get rid of the global app variable. 

Using angular.module() with two parameters (e.g. angular.module('my-module', [])) would result in setting a new module with its corresponding dependencies. In contrast, when using angular.module('my-module') the corresponding module is looked up internally and returned to the caller.

The means when you first define you application you might just create the following files and structure.
app.js
```script
angular.module('myApp', []);
```
FirstController.js
```script
angular.module('myApp').controller('FirstController', function () {});
```
SecondController.js
`angular.module('myApp').controller('SecondController', function () {});`

If you now include these files in your html document in this particularly order (at least app.js has to come first), your application works just fine with two separate controllers in two separate files.
