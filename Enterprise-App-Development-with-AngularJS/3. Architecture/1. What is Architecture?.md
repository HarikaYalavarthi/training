Architecture is the process of defining a structured solution that meets all of the technical and operational requirements, while optimizing common quality attributes such as performance, security, and manageability. It involves a series of decisions based on a wide range of factors, and each of these decisions can have considerable impact on the quality, performance, maintainability, and overall success of the application.
 
An architecture establishes a set of coding patterns and supporting classes that provides:
* A consistent and logical source code structure
* Separation of concerns
* Code reuse
