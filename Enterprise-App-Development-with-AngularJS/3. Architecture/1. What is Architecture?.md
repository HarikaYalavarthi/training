Architecture is the process of defining a structured solution that meets all of the technical and operational requirements, while optimizing common quality attributes such as performance, security, and manageability. 
 
An architecture establishes a set of coding patterns and supporting classes that provides:
* A consistent and logical source code structure
* Separation of concerns
* Code reuse
