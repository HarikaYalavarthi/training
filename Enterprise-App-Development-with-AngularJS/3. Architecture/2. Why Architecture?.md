Architecture focuses on how the major elements and components within an application are used by, or interact with, other major elements and components within the application.Architecture and design concerns very often overlap.In some cases, decisions are clearly more architectural in nature. In other cases,the decisions are more about design, and how they help you to realize that architecture.

#####The Goals of Architecture
* Application architecture seeks to build a bridge between business requirements and technical requirements by understanding use cases, and then finding ways to implement those use cases in the software. 
* To identify the requirements that affect the structure of the application. 
* Good architecture reduces the business risks associated with building a technical solution.
* A good design is sufficiently flexible to be able to handle the natural drift that will occur over time in hardware and software technology, as well as in user scenarios and requirements.
