Lets discuss about "Data Binding" inn Angular

* One way data binding
* One time data binding
* Two way data binding

###One way data binding:
A data binding can be specified in two different ways:
* Curly braces: {{expression}}
* `ng-bind` directive: ng-bind="varName"
Here model values are automatically assigned to the HTML placeholder elements specified through the data binding notation, but the HTML elements don't change the values in the model.

###One time data binding
Braces with  `::` is considered a one-time expression or one time binding.
one time binding will stop recalculating once they are stable, which happens after the first digest if the expression result is a non-undefined value.

###Two way data binding
Here the model value is updated between model and view. When ever user changes value it reflects in model.
We use the ng-model directive to bind a model variable to the HTML element that can not only display its value, but also change it.
When the view is loaded, the value of the input elements are initialized to those of the respective model variables and whenever the user types something in an input, the value of the model variable is modified as well.
