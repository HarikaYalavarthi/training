###Two way data binding
Here the model value is updated between model and view. When ever user changes value it reflects in model.
We use the ng-model directive to bind a model variable to the HTML element that can not only display its value, but also change it.

When the view is loaded, the value of the input elements are initialized to those of the respective model variables and whenever the user types something in an input, the value of the model variable is modified as well.
###Benefits and Considerations
The primary benefit of two-way data binding is that updates to (and retrievals from) the underlying data store happen more or less automatically. When the data store updates, the UI updates as well. This allows you to remove a lot of logic from the front-end display code, particularly when making effective use of AngularJS’s declarative approach to UI presentation. In essence, it allows for true data encapsulation on the front-end, reducing the need to do complex and destructive manipulation of the DOM.The only disadvantages is, AngularJS uses a dirty-checking approach that can be slow in some browsers – not a problem for thin presentation pages, but any page with heavy processing may run into problems in older browsers.
