Data binding establishes a connection between the application UI (User Interface) and model/business logic. 

###Classical Data Binding

* In classical templating systems, data binding occurs only in one direction.
* The classical template system merges template and model together into a view. 
* After this one-time merge, changes made in the model components and other sections of the view are not reflected in the view automatically.
