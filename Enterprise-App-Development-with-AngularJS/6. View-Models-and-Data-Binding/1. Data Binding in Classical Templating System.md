Data binding establishes a connection between the application UI (User Interface) and model/business logic. 

###Classical Data Binding

In classical templating systems, data binding occurs only in one direction. The classical template system merges template and model together into a view. After this one-time merge, changes made in the model components and other sections of the view are not reflected in the view automatically. Worse, any alterations made by the user to the view are also not reflected in the model. This means, in order to constantly sync the model with the view and the view with the model, developers need to manually manipulate the elements and attributes of DOM.

When a user makes any change to the view, this process becomes even more arduous and complicated. Because then, the developer is responsible for interpreting the user interactions, merging them into the model, and updating the model whenever any changes occur in the view.

####Explanation 
Here they merge template and model components together into a view. After the merge occurs, changes to the model or related sections of the view are NOT automatically reflected in the view. Worse, any changes that the user makes to the view are not reflected in the model. This means that the developer has to write code that constantly syncs the view with the model and the model with the view.
