A Single Page Application (SPA) is a web application or website that loads all of the resources required to navigate throughout the site on the first page load. 

AngularJS design goals:

* Decouple DOM manipulation from application logic.
* Regard application testing as equal in importance to application writing.
* Decouple the client side of an application from the server side.
* Guide developers through the entire journey of building an application.
