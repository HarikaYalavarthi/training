In the future (now) a creative person with even a modest knowledge of HTML, CSS and Javascript can build a proper contemporary “single page” web site. Out there on The Internet, Super-hardcore geeks are working together to solve all of the common problems of web development by building modular, reusable solutions. These open source projects put simple, powerful tools in the nimble hands of creative people. Powerful tools like AngularJS.

AngularJS is built around the belief that declarative programming should be used for building UIs and wiring software components, while imperative programming is excellent for expressing business logic. The framework adapts and extends traditional HTML to better serve dynamic content through two-way data-binding that allows for the automatic synchronization of models and views. As a result, AngularJS deemphasizes DOM manipulation and improves testability.

AngularJS design goals:

* Decouple DOM manipulation from application logic. This improves the testability of the code.
* Regard application testing as equal in importance to application writing. Testing difficulty is dramatically affected by the way the code is structured.
* Decouple the client side of an application from the server side. This allows development work to progress in parallel, and allows for reuse of both sides.
* Guide developers through the entire journey of building an application: from designing the UI, through writing the business logic, to testing.
