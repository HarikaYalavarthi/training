# Goal:

In the future (now) a creative person with even a modest knowledge of HTML, CSS and Javascript can build a proper contemporary “single page” web site. Out there on The Internet, Super-hardcore geeks are working together to solve all of the common problems of web development by building modular, reusable solutions. These open source projects put simple, powerful tools in the nimble hands of creative people. Powerful tools like AngularJS.
