### How it works
*	HTML document is loaded into the browser, and evaluated by the browser.
*	AngularJS JavaScript file is loaded, the angular global object is created.
*	The JavaScript which registers <a class="x-grid-item"  href='/slidedeck/#1. Overview/2 Core-Concepts/13. Controller target="_blank">controller</a> functions is executed.
*	Next, AngularJS scans through the HTML to search for AngularJS apps as well as views.
*	Once the view is located, it connects that view to the corresponding controller function.
*	Next, AngularJS executes the controller functions.
*	It then renders the views with data from the <a class="x-grid-item"  href='/slidedeck/#1. Overview/2 Core-Concepts/6. Model target="_blank">model</a> populated by the controller. The page is now ready.
