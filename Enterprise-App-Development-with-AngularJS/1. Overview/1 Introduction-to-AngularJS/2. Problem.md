First off, a Single Page Application is one in which we have a shell page and we can load multiple views into that.

So a traditional app, as you know you typically blink and load everything again. It’s not very efficient
on the bandwidth, especially in the mobile world.

In a Single Page Application(SPA) we can load the initial content upfront and then the different views or the little kind of mini- web pages can be loaded on the fly and embedded into the shell.

AngularJS, as we’re going to see, is a very good Single Page Application framework, but it’s not just for that. You don’t have to load these dynamic views with it. In fact if you wanted you could just use it for some of the cool separation of code that I’ll show you and data binding, but I will focus on SPAs here. 

#### The Challenge With Single Page Applications(SPAs)

The challenge with building Single Page Applications from scratch is there’s a lot of different issues to deal with: DOM manipulation and history and how do you dynamically load modules and how do you deal with promises when you make async calls and things like that.

Routing becomes a huge issue because you have to have some way to track “Where are we? And where are we going?”
