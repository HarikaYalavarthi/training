In classical applications we used to get data once the browser gets loaded.

* If any of the event need to be triggered then user need to wait again for browser load as it call server to get data and to rendered into view.
* Even if we want to change part of view, we used to call server for getting data and load browser to display in views.
* Though we used some client side script to modify view we need to write scripts to respond on events.
* And there is no promises on Asynchronous calls.
