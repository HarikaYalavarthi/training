Dependency Injection (DI) is a software design pattern that deals with how objects and functions get created and how they get a hold of their dependencies. Everything within Angular (directives, filters, controllers, services, ...) is created and wired using dependency injection. Within Angular, the DI container is called the injector.

To use DI, there needs to be a place where all the things that should work together are registered. In Angular, this is the purpose of the modules. When Angular starts, it will use the configuration of the module with the name defined by the ng-app directive, including the configuration of all modules that this module depends on.

In the example above: The template contains the directive ng-app="invoice2". This tells Angular to use the invoice2 module as the main module for the application. The code snippet angular.module('invoice2', ['finance2']) specifies that the invoice2 module depends on the finance2 module. By this, Angular uses the InvoiceController as well as the currencyConverter service.
