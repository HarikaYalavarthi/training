#1. Overview/2 Core-Concepts/14. Dependency Injection
<a class="x-grid-item"  href='/slidedeck/#1. Overview/2 Core-Concepts/14. Dependency Injection' target="_blank">Dependency Injection</a> (DI) is a software design pattern that deals with how objects and functions get created and how they get a hold of their dependencies. Everything within Angular (directives, filters, controllers, services, ...) is created and wired using dependency injection. Within Angular, the DI container is called the <a class="x-grid-item"  href='/slidedeck/#1. Overview/2 Core-Concepts/15. Injector' target="_blank">injector</a>.

To use DI, there needs to be a place where all the things that should work together are registered. In Angular, this is the purpose of the modules. When Angular starts, it will use the configuration of the module with the name defined by the ng-app directive, including the configuration of all modules that this module depends on.

In the image above: The template contains the directive ng-app="invoice2". This tells Angular to use the invoice2 module as the main module for the application. The code snippet angular.module('invoice2', ['finance2']) specifies that the invoice2 module depends on the finance2 module. By this, Angular uses the InvoiceController as well as the currencyConverter service.

Now that Angular knows of all the parts of the application, it needs to create them. In the previous section we saw that controllers are created using a factory function. For services there are multiple ways to define their factory (see the service guide). In the example above, we are using a function that returns the currencyConverter function as the factory for the service.

Back to the initial question: How does the InvoiceController get a reference to the currencyConverter function? In Angular, this is done by simply defining arguments on the constructor function. With this, the injector is able to create the objects in the right order and pass the previously created objects into the factories of the objects that depend on them. In our example, the InvoiceController has an argument named currencyConverter. By this, Angular knows about the dependency between the controller and the service and calls the controller with the service instance as argument.

The last thing that changed in the example between the previous section and this section is that we now pass an array to the module.controller function, instead of a plain function. The array first contains the names of the service dependencies that the controller needs. The last entry in the array is the controller constructor function. Angular uses this array syntax to define the dependencies so that the DI also works after minifying the code, which will most probably rename the argument name of the controller constructor function to something shorter like a.
