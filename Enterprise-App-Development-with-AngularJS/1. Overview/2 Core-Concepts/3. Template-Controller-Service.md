####Explanation:
 * The <a class="x-grid-item"  href='/slidedeck/#1. Overview/2 Core-Concepts/4. Template' target="_blank">template</a> contains the directive ng-app="invoice2". This tells Angular to use the invoice2 module as the main <a class="x-grid-item"  href='/slidedeck/#1. Overview/2 Core-Concepts/16. Module' target="_blank">module</a> for the application. 
 * The code snippet angular.module('invoice2', ['finance2']) specifies that the invoice2 module depends on the finance2 module. By this, Angular uses the InvoiceController as well as the currencyConverter service.
 * Now that Angular knows of all the parts of the application, it needs to create them.The controllers are created using a factory function. For services there are multiple ways to define their factory (see the service guide).

####Explanation:

* The InvoiceController contains all logic of our example. 
* When the application grows it is a good practice to move view-independent logic from the controller into a service, so it can be reused by other parts of the application as well. 
* Later on, we could also change that service to load the exchange rates from the web, e.g. by calling the Yahoo Finance API, without changing the controller.* 

####Usage of Dependency Injection 

* <a class="x-grid-item"  href='/slidedeck/#1. Overview/2 Core-Concepts/14. Dependency Injection' target="_blank">Dependency Injection</a> (DI) is a software design pattern that deals with how objects and functions get created and how they get a hold of their dependencies. 
* Everything within Angular (directives, filters, controllers, services, ...) is created and wired using dependency injection. Within Angular, the DI container is called the <a class="x-grid-item"  href='/slidedeck/#1. Overview/2 Core-Concepts/15. Injector' target="_blank">injector</a>.
* To use DI, there needs to be a place where all the things that should work together are registered. In Angular, this is the purpose of the <a class="x-grid-item"  href='/slidedeck/#1. Overview/2 Core-Concepts/16. Module' target="_blank">modules</a>.
* When Angular starts, it will use the configuration of the module with the name defined by the ng-app directive, including the configuration of all modules that this module depends on.
