###Templates
Templates are rendered view with information from the controller and model. These can be a single file (such as index.html) or multiple views in one page using partials.
The ng-template directive is used to create an HTML view using script tag. It contains id attribute which is used by $routeProvider to map a view with a controller.

###Overview
* AngularJS has a lot of great features for working with HTML that allows you to split up development when you are doing team projects.
* The binding approach and directives allows for a nice separation between developers and designers. 
* Another great piece of the platform is the ability to separate out HTML that you are using over and over again into a template file that can then be called by multiple different pages.
* In Angular when we talk of a template we really mean the view with the HTML enriched by the various Angular directives and the markup used for data binding .
* Angular, templates are written with HTML that contains Angular-specific elements and attributes. 
* The `ng-template` directive is used to create an HTML view using script tag. It contains idattribute which is used by `$routeProvider` to map a view with a controller. 
* Define a script block with type as ng-template within the main module
