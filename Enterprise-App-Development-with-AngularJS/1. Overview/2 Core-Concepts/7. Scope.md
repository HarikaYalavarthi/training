Scope is  real integral part of Angular , which is really another term for  ViewModel.###Features:* Scope is an object that refers to the application model. * It is an execution context for expressions. * Scopes are arranged in hierarchical structure which mimic the DOM structure of the application.* Scopes can watch expressions and propagate events.The glue between the View and the Controller is something called the Scope, and in Angular youâ€™re going to see a lot of objects or variables that start with `$`. `$scope` represents the scope object.Scopes provide APIs ($apply) to propagate any model changes through the system into the view from outside of the "Angular realm" (controllers, services, Angular event handlers).	<p data-height="268" data-theme-id="0" data-slug-hash="xwyyrw" data-default-tab="result" data-user="walkingtree" class='codepen'>See the Pen <a href='http://codepen.io/walkingtree/pen/xwyyrw/'>xwyyrw</a> by Walking Tree (<a href='http://codepen.io/walkingtree'>@walkingtree</a>) on <a href='http://codepen.io'>CodePen</a>.</p><script async src="//assets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>
