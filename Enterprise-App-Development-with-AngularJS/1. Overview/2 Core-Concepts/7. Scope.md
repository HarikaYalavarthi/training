> **Core Concepts - Scope**

>

> Scope is real integral part of Angular , which is really another term

> for **ViewModel**.

> **Features:**



-   [**Scope**](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/type/$rootScope.Scope) is

    an object that refers to the application model.



-   It is an execution context

    for [**expressions**](https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/expression).

    you can refer this url to know about expressions in detail

    Overview/2 Core-Concepts/8.

    Expressions](http://slidedeck.walkingtree.in/slidedeck/%231.%20Overview/2%20Core-Concepts/8.%20Expressions)



-   Scopes are arranged in hierarchical structure which mimic the DOM

    structure of the application.



-   Scopes can

    watch [**expressions**](https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/expression) and

    propagate events.

> **Code Flow: **



-   The glue between the View and the Controller is something called the

    **Scope**.



-   The scope transfers data, watch expressions and propagate events

    from view to controller and Controller to view



-   Scope acts as a center between view and controller and effects view

    when controller changes and vice-versa



    **Usage:**



-   In AngularJs , lot of objects or variables that start with \$.



-   **\$scope** represents the scope object.



-   Scopes provide APIs

    ([**\$apply**](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/type/$rootScope.Scope#$apply))

    to propagate any model changes through the system into the view from

    outside of the "Angular realm" (controllers, services, Angular

    event handlers).

> &lt;p data-height="268" data-theme-id="0" data-slug-hash="xwyyrw"

> data-default-tab="result" data-user="walkingtree"

> class='codepen'&gt;See the Pen &lt;a

> href='http://codepen.io/walkingtree/pen/xwyyrw/'&gt;xwyyrw&lt;/a&gt;

> by Walking Tree (&lt;a

> href='http://codepen.io/walkingtree'&gt;@walkingtree&lt;/a&gt;) on

> &lt;a href='http://codepen.io'&gt;CodePen&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

> &lt;script async

> src="//assets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

> **Explanation:**



-   In the above example notice that the "ctrl" assigns Hello and

    World to the firstname and lastname property of the scope.



-   The scope then notifies the input of the assignment, which then

    renders the input with firstname and lastname pre-filled.



-   This demonstrates how a controller can write data into the scope.



-   Similarly the controller can assign behavior to scope as seen by the

    login method, which is invoked when the user clicks on the

    'Login' button.



-   The login method can read the user data property and create a

    user.firstname, user.lastname  property.



-   This demonstrates that the properties on scope update automatically

    when they are bound to HTML input widgets.
