Scope is  real integral part of Angular , which is really another term for  ViewModel.
###Features:
* Scope is an object that refers to the application model.
* It is an execution context for expressions. 
* Scopes are arranged in hierarchical structure which mimic the DOM structure of the application.
* Scopes can watch expressions and propagate events.

###Code Flow:
*	The glue between the View and the Controller is something called the Scope.
*	The scope transfers data, watch expressions and propagate events from view to controller and Controller to view
*	Scope acts as a center between view and controller and effects view when controller changes and vice-versa

###Usage:
* In AngularJs , lot of objects or variables that start with $. 
* $scope represents the scope object.
*	Scopes provide APIs ($apply) to propagate any model changes through the system into the view from outside of the "Angular realm" (controllers, services, Angular event handlers).

###Explanation:
*	In the above example notice that the "ctrl" assigns Hello and World to the firstname and lastname property of the scope.
*	The scope then notifies the input of the assignment, which then renders the input with firstname and lastname  pre-filled.
*	This demonstrates how a controller can write data into the scope.	
*	Similarly the controller can assign behavior to scope as seen by the login method, which is invoked when the user clicks on the 'Login' button.
*	The login method can read the user data property and create a user.firstname, user.lastname  property.
* This demonstrates that the properties on scope update automatically when they are bound to HTML input widgets.
