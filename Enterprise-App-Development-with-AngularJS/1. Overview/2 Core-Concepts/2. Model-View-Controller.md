MVC stands for Model View Controller which is very popular design pattern in web world. It helps you to organise your application in three different layers and isolate the business logic from its presentation.

Model- represent current state and data of your application.

```javascript
<script>  
var myapp = angular.module('myapp', []);
myapp.controller('myctrl', function($scope) {
    $scope.company =  {  
         'Name'    :   'Walking tree',  
         'Address' :   '2E, 2nd Floor, Samriddhi Vasyam Jaihind Enclave Road',  
         'Email'   :   'sales@walkingtree.in'  
    };
         });
</script>
```

View - responsible to display/show the data.

```html
<p>{{company.Name}} </p>  
<p> {{company.Address}} </p>  
<p> {{company.Email}} </p>  
```

Controller - responsible to controls the relation between Models and Views.

```javascript
<script>  
function RealCustomer($scope){  
}  
</script>
```
