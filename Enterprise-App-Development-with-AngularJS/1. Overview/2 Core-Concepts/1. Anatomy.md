Perform the following steps:
- [x] To start, let's first download a version of AngularJS from http:www.angularjs.org.
- [x] Click on the Download button and select the following options from the pop-up window:
- [x] Branch: Select Stable
- [x] Build: Select Minified
- [x] You also have access to a CDN. The CDN will give you access around the world to regional data centers that in this case, Google host. This means using CDN moves the responsibility of hosting files from your own servers to a series of external ones.
```javascript
<script src = "https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.3.0-beta.17/angular.min.js"></script>
```
Download the JS file and place it in your project's folder.
Let us start by writing a simple AngularJS app. Create an index.html file with the following code:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>AngularJS Basic</title>
</head>
<body ng-app ng-init=" myName ='John Doe' ">
    {{myName}} is {{ 2014-1968}} years old.
    <script src="angular.min.js" type="text/javascript"> </script>
</body>
</html>
```
