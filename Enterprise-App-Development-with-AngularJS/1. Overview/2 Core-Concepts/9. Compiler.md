*	Compiles an HTML string or DOM into a template and produces a template function, which can then be used to link scope and the template together.
*	The compilation is a process of walking the DOM tree and matching DOM elements to directives.
####Compiler:
Compiler is an Angular service which traverses the DOM looking for attributes. The compilation process happens in two phases.
*	Compile: traverse the DOM and collect all of the directives. The result is a linking function.
*	Link: combine the directives with a scope and produce a live view. Any changes in the scope model are reflected in the view, and any user interactions with the view are reflected in the scope model. This makes the scope model the single source of truth.
