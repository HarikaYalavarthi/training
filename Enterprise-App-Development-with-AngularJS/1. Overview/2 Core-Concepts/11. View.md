###overview:
* `ngView` is a directive that complements the $route  service by including the rendered template of the current route into the main layout (index.html) file. 
* Every time the current route changes, the included view changes with it according to the configuration of the  $routeservice.

####Usage:
 Requires the ngRoute module to be installed.Define a div with ng-view within the main module.
```html
<div ng-app = "mainApp">
   ...
   <div ng-view></div>

</div>    
```
`ng-view` tag simply creates a place holder where a corresponding view (html or ng-template view) can be placed based on the configuration.
