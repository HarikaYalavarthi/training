###Overview

In Angular, a Controller is defined by a JavaScript constructor function that is used to augment the Angular scope.

###Features
*	When a Controller is attached to the DOM via the ng-controller directive, Angular will instantiate a new Controller object, using the specified Controller's constructor function. 
* A new child scope will be created and made available as an injectable parameter to the Controller's constructor function as $scope.

Explanation:
* In above example explains the way the view and controller are getting binded.
* The view contains two buttons Chili and Jalapeño and paragraph containg ```{{spice}}```
* On click of each button the spice value changes in the view which is achieved by declaring ```$scope.spice = 'chili';```,```$scope.spice = 'jalapeño';``` in controller.

####Use controllers to:
- [x]	Set up the initial state of the $scope object.
- [x]	Add behavior to the $scope object.

####Do not use controllers to:
- [x]	Manipulate DOM — Controllers should contain only business logic. Putting any presentation logic into Controllers significantly affects its testability. Angular has databinding  for most cases and directives  to encapsulate manual DOM manipulation.
- [x]	Format input — Use angular form controls instead.
- [x]	Filter output — Use angular filters instead.
- [x]	Share code or state across controllers — Use angular services instead.
- [x]	Manage the life-cycle of other components
