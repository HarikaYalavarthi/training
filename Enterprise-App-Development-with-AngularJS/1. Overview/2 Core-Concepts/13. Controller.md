###Overview

In Angular, a Controller is defined by a JavaScript constructor function that is used to augment the Angular scope.

###Features
- [x]	When a Controller is attached to the DOM via the ng-controller directive, Angular will instantiate a new Controller object, using the specified Controller's constructor function. 
- [x]	A new child scope will be created and made available as an injectable parameter to the Controller's constructor function as $scope.

####Use controllers to:
- [x]	Set up the initial state of the $scope object.
- [x]	Add behavior to the $scope object.
####Do not use controllers to:
- [x]	Manipulate DOM — Controllers should contain only business logic. Putting any presentation logic into Controllers significantly affects its testability. Angular has databinding  for most cases and directives  to encapsulate manual DOM manipulation.
- [x]	Format input — Use angular form controls instead.
- [x]	Filter output — Use angular filters instead.
- [x]	Share code or state across controllers — Use angular services instead.
- [x]	Manage the life-cycle of other components
