Models are plain old JavaScript objects that represent data used by your app. Models are also used to represent your app's current state.

ng-model : This directive binds the values of AngularJS application data to HTML input controls.

<p data-height="268" data-theme-id="0" data-slug-hash="XmoJEE" data-default-tab="result" data-user="walkingtree" class='codepen'>See the Pen <a href='http://codepen.io/walkingtree/pen/XmoJEE/'>XmoJEE</a> by Walking Tree (<a href='http://codepen.io/walkingtree'>@walkingtree</a>) on <a href='http://codepen.io'>CodePen</a>.</p>

#### Explanation

In the above example `firstname` and `lastname` are set at controller with initial values i.e John and Doe.

`ngModel` is the <a class="x-grid-item"  href='/slidedeck/#1. Overview/2 Core-Concepts/5. Directives' target="_blank">directives</a> which updated views as well as model up on user response. as initially they are set to John and Doe which will be displayed for the first time in view. Once the user updates/ modifies these scope variable  `firstname` and `lastname` ng-model directive updated data. and this updated data will rendered and displayed in view.
