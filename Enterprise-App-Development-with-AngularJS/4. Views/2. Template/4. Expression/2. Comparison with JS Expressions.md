###Angular expressions are like JavaScript expressions with the following differences:

*	Context: 
  - JavaScript expressions are evaluated against the global window. 
  - In Angular, expressions are evaluated against a scopeobject.
*	Forgiving: 
  - In JavaScript, trying to evaluate undefined properties generates ReferenceError or TypeError. 
  - In Angular, expression evaluation is forgiving to undefined and null.
*	No Control Flow Statements: 
  - Cannot use the following in an Angular expression: conditionals, loops, or exceptions.
*	No Function Declarations: 
  - Cannot declare functions in an Angular expression, even inside ng-init directive.
*	No RegExp Creation With Literal Notation: 
  - Cannot create regular expressions in an Angular expression.
*	No Comma And Void Operators:
  - Cannot use , or void in an Angular expression.
*	Filters: 
  - Can use filters within expressions to format data before displaying it.
   
`ðŸ’¡ Note: Using ng-init is not very common. Need to learn a better way to initialize data in the chapter about controllers.`
