###Simple Form:
*	The key directive in understanding two-way data-binding is ngModel.
*	The ngModel directive provides the two-way data-binding by synchronizing the model to the view, as well as view to the model.Refer the <a class="x-grid-item"  href='http://slidedeck.walkingtree.in/slidedeck/#1. Overview/2 Core-Concepts/6. Model'>Model</a> to know more about ```ng-model```
*	In two-way data-binding,  Model variables are assigned to the View (the HTML), then everytime values change in the controller, the View is automatically updated to reflect them and vice-versa.

```
<div id="messages" class="alert alert-success" data-ng-show="messages" data-ng-bind="messages"></div>
```  
* Each form field in our form has different validation depending on its nature.

```
<label for="email">Your E-mail address</label>
<span class="label label-danger" data-ng-show="submitted && helpForm.email.$error.required">Required!</span>
<span class="label label-danger" data-ng-show="submitted && helpForm.$error.email">Invalid email!</span>
<input type="email" name="email" data-ng-model="email" class="form-control" required />  
```

`ðŸ’¡ Note: novalidate is used to disable browser's native form validation.`

###Explanation:
* In the above example,validation is applied to the each field using type config depending on its nature.
* two-way-binding is applied as the data changes in form are observed in the controller in user object
* submit button is used to save form data to master and reset to reset form values
