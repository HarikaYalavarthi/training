Using CSS Classes
Usage:
To allow styling of form as well as controls, ngModel adds these CSS classes:
* ngModel adds these CSS classes:
  - ng-valid: the model is valid
  - ng-invalid: the model is invalid
  - ng-valid-[key]: for each valid key added by $setValidity
  - ng-invalid-[key]: for each invalid key added by $setValidity
  - ng-pristine: the control hasn't been interacted with yet
  - ng-dirty: the control has been interacted with
  - ng-touched: the control has been blurred
  - ng-untouched: the control hasn't been blurred
  - ng-pending: any $asyncValidators are unfulfilled

<p data-height="268" data-theme-id="0" data-slug-hash="MaZYNV" data-default-tab="result" data-user="walkingtree" class='codepen'>See the Pen <a href='http://codepen.io/walkingtree/pen/MaZYNV/'>MaZYNV</a> by Walking Tree (<a href='http://codepen.io/walkingtree'>@walkingtree</a>) on <a href='http://codepen.io'>CodePen</a>.</p>

###Explanation:
* The following example uses the CSS to display validity of each form control.
* In the example both user.name and user.email are required, but are rendered with red background only after the input is blurred (loses focus). 
* This ensures that the user is not distracted with an error until after interacting with the control, and failing to satisfy its validity.
