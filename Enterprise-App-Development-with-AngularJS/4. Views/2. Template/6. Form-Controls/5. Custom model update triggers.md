###Overview:
*	By default, any change to the content will trigger a model update and form validation. 
*	You can override this behavior using the ngModelOptions directive to bind only to specified list of events. 

###Usage:
*	By default, change in content of the input element triggers the model update and validates the form. 
*	However, we can override this behavior by attaching ng-model-options  directive with event name to the input element.
*	The values of the ng-model-options  can be following
*	{updateOn : 'blur'} - updates the model when this element loose focus
*	{updateOn : 'mouseup'} - updates the model when this element is clicked and mouse button is released
*	{updateOn : 'default'} - updates the model with default behavior, as and when the key is pressed
*	{updateOn : 'default mousedown'} - updates the model with default behavior, as and when the key is pressed or mousedown event fires on the element

###ngModelOptions:
*	Using ngModelOptions you can specify a custom list of events that will trigger a model update.
* Actual update only takes place when timer will be reset after another change takes place.
