###Overview:
* A form is an instance of FormController.
*	The form instance can optionally be published into the scope using the name  attribute.
*	An input control that has the ngModel directive holds an instance of  NgModelController. 

###Usage:
*	The  internal state of both the form and the control is available for binding in the view using the standard binding primitives.
*	The form and its control state can be validated based on following properties of the form and its control
*	$touched - This property is used with HTML element to know whether user  	has interacted with this element
*	$submitted - This property is used with HTML form to know whether user has submitted the form
*	Some of the functions used
*	$scope.Submit - method is used to simply set the Main property to the form elements property.
*	$scope.Reset - method is used to reset the form state to Pristine mode and untouched  mode by calling $setPristine() and $setUntouced() method.Refer the <a class="x-grid-item"  href='http://slidedeck.walkingtree.in/slidedeck/#1.

###Explanation
This allows us to extend the above example with these features:
* Custom error message displayed after the user interacted with a control (i.e. when $touched is set)
* Custom error message displayed upon submitting the form ($submitted is set), even if the user didn't interact with a control
