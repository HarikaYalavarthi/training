###Form Controls
* Controls (input, select, textarea) are ways for a user to enter data
* A Form is a collection of controls for the purpose of grouping related controls together
* Form and controls provide validation services ,so that the user can be notified of invalid input before submitting a form. 
* This provides a better user experience than server-side validation alone because the user gets instant feedback on how to correct the error
* `ngModel` is used to configure two-way binding to update the model with the user input value

###Form elements
A Form is a collection of controls for the purpose of grouping related controls together. Form Controls are ways for a user to enter data.Some of the form controls are
*	input elements
*	select elements
*	textarea elements

###input elements
HTML input element control. When used together with ngModel, it provides data-binding, input state control, and validation.
```
<input
  ng-model="string"
  [name="string"]
  [required="string"]
  [ng-required="boolean"]
  [ng-minlength="number"]
  [ng-maxlength="number"]
  [ng-pattern="string"]
  [ng-change="string"]
  [ng-trim="boolean"]>
</input>
```

###select elements
The select directive is used together with ngModel  to provide data-binding between the scope and the ```<select>``` control . ÃŒt also handles dynamic  ```<option>```  elements, which can be added using the ngRepeat or ngOptions directives.
```
<select
  ng-model="string"
  [name="string"]
  [multiple="string"]
  [required="string"]
  [ng-required="string"]
  [ng-change="string"]
  [ng-options="string"]>
</select>
```

###textarea elements
HTML textarea element control with angular data-binding. The data-binding and validation properties of this element are exactly the same as those of the input element.
```
<textarea
  ng-model="string"
  [name="string"]
  [required="string"]
  [ng-required="string"]
  [ng-minlength="number"]
  [ng-maxlength="number"]
  [ng-pattern="string"]
  [ng-change="string"]
  [ng-trim="boolean"]>
</textarea>
```
