* Controls (input, select, textarea) are ways for a user to enter data
* A Form is a collection of controls for the purpose of grouping related controls together
* Form and controls provide validation services ,so that the user can be notified of invalid input before submitting a form. 
* This provides a better user experience than server-side validation alone because the user gets instant feedback on how to correct the error
* `ngModel` is used to configure two-way binding to update the model with the user input value

##Form Validation
Each form field in our form has different validation depending on its nature. Here is the HTML for the email field:

<label for="email">Your E-mail address</label>
<span class="label label-danger" data-ng-show="submitted && helpForm.email.$error.required">Required!</span>
<span class="label label-danger" data-ng-show="submitted && helpForm.$error.email">Invalid email!</span>
<input type="email" name="email" data-ng-model="email" class="form-control" required />
