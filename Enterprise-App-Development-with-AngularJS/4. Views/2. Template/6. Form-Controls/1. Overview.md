* Controls (input, select, textarea) are ways for a user to enter data
* A Form is a collection of controls for the purpose of grouping related controls together
* Form and controls provide validation services ,so that the user can be notified of invalid input before submitting a form. 
* This provides a better user experience than server-side validation alone because the user gets instant feedback on how to correct the error
* `ngModel` is used to configure two-way binding to update the model with the user input value
