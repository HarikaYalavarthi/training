* AngularJS let us extend HTML with new attributes called Directives.
* Directives are the most important components of any AngularJS application.
* Directives are markers on a DOM element which attach a special behavior to it.
* At a high level, directives are markers on a DOM element (such as an attribute, element name, comment or CSS class) that tell AngularJS's HTML compiler ($compile) to attach a specified behavior to that DOM element (e.g. via event listeners), or even to transform the DOM element and its children.
* Angular comes with a set of these directives built-in, like ngBind, ngModel, and ngClass. 
*  Can create our own directives for Angular to use same as controllers and services.
*  Angular bootstraps application, the HTML compiler traverses the DOM matching directives against the DOM elements.

###Usage
* AngularJS directives are extended HTML attributes with the prefix ```ng-```.
* The ```ng-app``` directive initializes an AngularJS application.
* The ```ng-init``` directive initializes application data.
* The ```ng-model``` directive binds the value of HTML controls (input, select, textarea) to application data.
