### Directives are processed by $compiler
*	Compiles an HTML string or DOM into a template and produces a template function, which can then be used to link <a href="/slidedeck/#1. Overview/2 Core-Concepts/7. Scope" target="_blank">scope</a> and the <a href="/slidedeck/#1. Overview/2 Core-Concepts/4. Template" target="_blank">template</a> together.
*	The compilation is a process of walking the DOM tree and matching DOM elements to directives.

`ðŸ’¡ Note: For AngularJS, "compilation" means attaching directives to the HTML to make it interactive.`

###Compiler:
Compiler is an Angular service which traverses the DOM looking for attributes. The compilation process happens in two phases.
*	Compile: traverse the DOM and collect all of the directives. The result is a linking function.
*	Link: combine the directives with a scope and produce a live view. Any changes in the scope model are reflected in the view, and any user interactions with the view are reflected in the scope model. This makes the scope model the single source of truth.

##Explanation
* Here is a <a class="x-grid-item"  href='/slidedeck/#1. Overview/2 Core-Concepts/5. Directives' target="_blank">directive</a> which makes any element draggable. Notice the draggable attribute on the <span> element
* The presence of the draggable attribute on any element gives the element new behavior. 
* Extended the vocabulary of the browser in a way which is natural to anyone who is familiar with the principles of HTML.
