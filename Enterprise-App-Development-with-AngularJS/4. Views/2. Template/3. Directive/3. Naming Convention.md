* AngularJS directives allow us to use our own vocabulary to create semantic HTML components. 
* To take advantage of that we should be aware of how it works to avoid some annoying and hard to find issues.

###Naming convention
* Directives have camel cased names such as ngApp
* Directive can be invoked by translating the camel case name into snake case with these special characters :, -, or _. E.g. ng-app/ng:app/ng_app for ngApp
* Recommendation is to use dash. E.g. ng-app for ngApp
* To use an HTML validating tool, you can instead use the data-prefixed version (e.g. data-ng-app for ngApp)

###Differences between defining and using

#Defining (the JS)
To define a new custom directives all we need to do is use the directive method which expects two parameters: a name and a constructor function.
