###Overview:
*	A filter is very similar to an factory or service in many regards but has the added advantage of behaving on a global scope once created. 
*	We can  invoke a filter on both the data binding in your html or directly inside of your controller or directive by using the $filter service. 

###Usage:
*	Register a new filter factory function with your module.
*	Internally, this uses the filterProvider. 
*	This factory function should return a new filter function which takes the input value as the first argument.
*	Any filter arguments are passed in as additional arguments to the filter function.
*	The filter function should be a pure function, which means that it should be stateless and idempotent. 
*	Angular relies on these properties and executes the filter only when the inputs to the function change.
```script
app.filter('myFilter',function(){
	return function(input,optional1,optional2){
		var output;
		//do something here
		return output;
	}
});
```

###Explanation
* The following sample filter reverses a text string. In addition, it conditionally makes the text upper-case.
* A text field is created and added filter using code ```{{greeting|reverse}}```
* Whwnever the text field is changed the filter method is invoked and modifies the content.
