*	A filter is very similar to an factory or service in many regards but has the added advantage of behaving on a global scope once created. 
*	 Invoke a filter on both the <a href="/slidedeck/#6. View-Models-and-Data-Binding/1. Data Binding in Classical Templating System" target="_blank">data binding</a> in  html or directly inside of controller or directive by using the $filter service. 
*Process of creating new filter	 
	-	Register a new filter factory function with module.
	-	Internally, this uses the filterProvider. 
	-	This factory function should return a new filter function which takes the input value as the first argument.
	-	Any filter arguments are passed in as additional arguments to the filter function.
	-	The filter function should be a pure function, which means that it should be stateless and idempotent. 
	-	Angular relies on these properties and executes the filter only when the inputs to the function change.	

```script
app.filter('myFilter',function(){
	return function(input,optional1,optional2){
		var output;
		//do something here
		return output;
	}
});
```

```html
ðŸ’¡ Note: Filter names must be valid angular Expressions identifiers, such as uppercase or orderBy. Names with special characters, such as hyphens and dots, are not allowed. If wish to namespace filters, then capitalization  (myappSubsectionFilterx) or underscores (myapp_subsection_filterx) can be used.
