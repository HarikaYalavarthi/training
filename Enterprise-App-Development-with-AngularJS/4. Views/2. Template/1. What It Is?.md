####Overview:
* AngularJS has a lot of great features for working with HTML that allows to split up development when team projects are done.
* The binding approach and directives allows for a nice separation between developers and designers. 
* Another great piece of the platform is the ability to separate out HTML that are using over and over again into a template file that can then be called by multiple different pages.

####Defnition:
* In Angular the talk of a template really mean the view with the HTML enriched by the various Angular directives and the markup used for data binding .
* Angular, templates are written with HTML that contains Angular-specific elements and attributes. 

####Usage:
* The ng-template directive is used to create an HTML view using script tag. It contains idattribute which is used by $routeProvider to map a view with a controller. 
* Define a script block with type as ng-template within the main module

####Features:
