#### Template
Template is partial html where it holds dynamic data from model and rendered and display it as view.

Web templates can be used by any individual or organization to set up their website. Once a template is purchased or downloaded, the user will replace all generic information included in the web template with their own personal, organizational or product information. Examples of common uses of Templates are listed below:

Display personal information or daily activities as in a blog.
Sell products on-line.
Display information about a company or organization.
Display family history.
Display a gallery of photos.
Place music files such as MP3 files on-line for play through a web browser.
Place videos on-line for public viewing.
To set up a private login area on-line.

#### Container
* In HTML, the container is the area enclosed by the beginning and ending tags. For example < HTML > encloses an entire document while other tags may enclose a single word, paragraph, or other elements. In HTML code, all container must have a start and stop tag to close the container. Without a stop tag the start tag will apply to the entire document.
* In software development terminology, the word container is used to describe any component that can contain other components inside itself.
* In video terminology, container is often used to specifically describe a container format.

#### Layouts
HTML5 offers new semantic elements that define different parts of a web page:

#### Events
Events are those which triggers when there is expected user action happens.
In Angular JS we have some events which will be explained below

The ng-click directive defines an AngularJS click event.
<p data-height="268" data-theme-id="0" data-slug-hash="yYryJm" data-default-tab="result" data-user="walkingtree" class='codepen'>See the Pen <a href='http://codepen.io/walkingtree/pen/yYryJm/'>yYryJm</a> by Walking Tree (<a href='http://codepen.io/walkingtree'>@walkingtree</a>) on <a href='http://codepen.io'>CodePen</a>.</p>
<script async src="//assets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>
#### Explanation 
In the above example when ever user enters input model variable `username` is updated with this value.
This is because of two way data binding in Angular and when ever he clciks in clear button the model varial `username` is updated with empty value. 

The ng-hide directive can be used to set the visibility of a part of an application.

The value ng-hide="true" makes an HTML element invisible.

The ng-show directive can also be used to set the visibility of a part of an application.

The value ng-show="false" makes an HTML element invisible.

The value ng-show="true" makes the element visible.

Here is the same example as above, using ng-show instead of ng-hide

<p data-height="268" data-theme-id="0" data-slug-hash="yYryem" data-default-tab="result" data-user="walkingtree" class='codepen'>See the Pen <a href='http://codepen.io/walkingtree/pen/yYryem/'>yYryem</a> by Walking Tree (<a href='http://codepen.io/walkingtree'>@walkingtree</a>) on <a href='http://codepen.io'>CodePen</a>.</p>
<script async src="//assets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>

#### Explanation
* When we click on show/ hide showme is set to true/ false

* Showme is evaluated and content is display based on that.

* If ng-show is true then content will display or else hides.

* If ng-hide is true then content will hides or else displays.

* The application has a default property (a variable): $scope.showme = false;

* The ng-hide directive sets the visibility, of a <p> element with two input fields, according to the value (true or false) of myVar.

* The function toggle() toggles myVar between true and false.

* The value ng-hide="true" makes the element invisible.

* The value ng-hide="false" makes the element visible.

#### Styles

The ngStyle directive allows you to set CSS style on an HTML element conditionally.

| Param	| Type	| Details|
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
|ngStyle |	expression	|Expression which evals to an object whose keys are CSS style names and values are corresponding values for those CSS keys.Since some CSS style names are not valid keys for an object, they must be quoted. See the background-color style in the example below.|
